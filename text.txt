VSTech Limited: As part of the tech team at VSTech Limited, I worked on the development of an interactive and fully operational website for the company. Using my skills in full-stack engineering and troubleshooting, I was able to collaborate with the team to build a website that met the high standards of the company.
Applemaster: I created an e-commerce website with full functionality, including an integrated payment system and order tracing. This project required attention to detail and expertise in web development, as I worked to ensure that the site was user-friendly and efficient.
The Inquiry Hub: For this project, I developed an app for content writers that allows clients to leave jobs, which are then allocated to writers to complete. This project required a deep understanding of mobile app development and user experience, as well as the ability to collaborate with clients and other developers.
BrainBox: I developed a system that allows users to join a game, make a deposit, and answer a few questions to earn money from the ones they score correctly. This project involved both front-end and back-end development, and required a strong understanding of payment integration and game mechanics.
